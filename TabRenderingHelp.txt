<h2>The galaxy list</h2>
GAMER constantly has a single galaxy loaded in memory, called the working galaxy. In the galaxy list view, you are presented with a list of the GAMER galaxy .gax files which are located default at the path "/galaxies".
This path can be changed in the settings section. Open a galaxy by double-clicking on an item in the list. You can also rename a galaxy by changing the name in the uppermost input field. The galaxy
filename is automatically updated.<br>
<br>
The list is refreshed every time you create, delete, clone or change the current working galaxy.
<h2>The galaxy renderer</h2>
The current galaxy is continuously rendered in low-resolution preview mode, and is displayed on the right-hand panel. In preview mode, you can rotate the camera around the center of the galaxy
by right-clicking and dragging the mouse. By pressing the "Alt"-button and right-clicking and dragging, you can zoom the camera.<br>
<br>
When you have obtained a suitable camera, press the "Renderer"-button (or press command+R) to perform a full rendering of the current scene. Press "Save" to save the image. The image is automatically
saved to the image directory (specified in the "Settings" tab).
<h2>The rendering parameters</h2>
Above the galaxy list, you are presented with some of the global rendering parameters. When changed, they are automatically saved and a new preview image is created. They are:
<ul>
    <li><b>Image size</b>: Pixel width / height of the rendered image
    <li><b>Image size</b>: Pixel width / height of the preview image. Lower detail for faster preview.
    <li><b>Ray step value</b>: Internally, every galaxy is confined within a 3D sphere of size 1. The ray step value defines the step size for the ray marching. For images that are either
    large or have a camera that is close to the geometry of the galaxy (disk, dust, bulge etc), a lower step size will result in a much better image. However, increased step size will also
    greatly increase rendering time. If you notice images with circular noise patterns, the step size is probably too high.
    <li><b>Field of view (FOV)</b> defines the width of the camera angle in degrees. For wide-field images of galaxies, place the camera close to a galaxy and set a high field-of-view (say, 90 degrees). For
    near-flat perspectie, set a field-of-view at low values and zoom the camera far away.
</ul>
