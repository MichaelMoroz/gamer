<h2>Post Processing</h2>
In this panel, you can edit post-processing effects. The effects only affect the final color (png) image, and does not apply to raw FITS files. Parameters
are:
<ul>
    <li><b>Exposure</b>: The pixel is scaled with 1/exposure.
    <li><b>Gamma</b>: The pixel is scaled with pow(pixel, gamma)
    <li><b>Saturation</b>: Color saturation, from black/white to intense colors.
</ul>
<h2>Foreground star field</h2>
In addition, it is possible to add a simulated foreground star field to the saved .png image.
For now, the stars are rendered as 2D gaussian spots, but when a proper PSF is implemented the convolution will take care of the smoothing of the foreground stars.

The parameters are as follows:
<ul>
   <li><b>Number of stars</b>: Number of stars to render.
   <li><b>Mean</b>: The mean width of the stars, normalized to fit the width of the image (so changing resolution won't change the size of the star)
   <li><b>Sigma</b>: The standard deviation (spread) of the width of the star.
   <li><b>Intensity</b>: The overall intensity modifier of the star field.
</ul>
