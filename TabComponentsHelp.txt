<h2>The components list</h2>
Galaxies contains a list of components. A galaxy can contain any number of components, and there are in total four component types that you can create or delete from the list. To create a
new component, press the "New component" button. The new component will be added to the end of the list, with a basic <b>bulge</b> component template.
You can select any component from the uppermost drop-down list. Each component can be switched on / off by clicking the "is active" checkbox. In addition, each component
has its own defined spectrum, which can be chosen from the lowermost drop-down list. <br>
<br>
Every component has its own set of parameters, which is listed below.
<h2>Bulge</h2>
The bulge represents the spherical center of the galaxy, and produces light intensity. The bulge contains no noise, so parameters are few:
<ul>
    <li><b>Strength</b> :The overall light intensity of the bulge. Increases with higher values of R0.
    <li><b>R0</b> : The overall width of the bulge. Decreases with increased R0.
</ul>
<h2>Disk / Dust</h2>
The disk and dust components are affected by the galaxy arm parameters defined in the galaxy panel. The disk component produces light intensity, while
the dust component absorbs light intensity (see the GAMER paper for details). Both are modulated by procedural noise. The parameters for both components are:
<ul>
    <li><b>Strength</b> :Defines the overall intensity of the component. If a disk component, light intensity is increased. If a dust component, light absorption.
    <li><b>Arm</b> :The width of the components arm, given by the winding parameters in the galaxy settings. For lower values, arms are wider, while high values result in a thin arm. Typical values range between 0 and 1.
    <li><b>Z0</b> :This parameter defines the height of the component above the galaxy plane. Typical values range between 0.001 - 0.05.
    <li><b>R0</b> :The radial intensity drop-off of the component, typically within 0 and 1. As 1 is at the edge of the  defined agalaxy, typical values range between 0.1 and 0.6.
    <li><b>Delta</b> :A tangential displacement of the arm, in case a component should be "lagging" behind the main arms. Typically between 0 and &#960;.
    <li><b>Winding</b> :The tangential winding ("twird") number of the commponent. Higher values yield more tangential "twirl" effect along the arms. Typical values between 0 and 0.5.
    <li><b>Noise Scale</b> :The base scale of the procedural noise. Lower values mean larger scales. Typical values range around 1.
    <li><b>Offset </b> :Noise offset is a threshold constant that is added to the noise field. Typical values are centered around 0.
    <li><b>Tilt </b>: The noise field is eventually transformed through an poer function, so the final noise value becomes noise = pow(noise, Tilt). Typicall set around -1 and 1.
    <li><b>Ks</b>: The frequency modifier (or persistence) of the noise field. Lower values yields more large-scale perturbations, while larger values favor small-scale. Typically set around 1.
</ul>
<h2>Stars</h2>
Star components operate on a different set of procedural noise, effectively producing small delta-function-alike perturbations in the 3D field. The main component parameters (strength,
arm, Z0, R0, Delta and Winding, Noise Tilt, Noise Offset) are the same as in the Disk/Dust. However, the noise scale parmeters operate slightly different. Typical values for the noise scale is here in the range of 10-100.
